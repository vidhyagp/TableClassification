Property: Majority lines belonging to the table areas are sparse in terms of the text density

Sparse Line: A document line is a sparse line if any of the following condition is satisfied: 
1)The minimum space gap between a pair of consecutive words within
the line is larger than a threshold sg. 
2) The length of the line is much shorter than a threshold ll;

Even though sparse lines cover almost all table lines, a few
non-table lines mingle in. Removing these noise lines can fa-
cilitate the table boundary detection e±ciently. Therefore,
for the labeled SPARSE lines, we label them as the following
six categories: CAPTIONSPARSE, HEADINGSPARSE, FO-
OTNOTESPARSE, REFERENCESPARSE, HEADERFO-
OTERSPARSE, and OTHERSPARSE.

Wise choice of features is always vital to the final results.

Line Construction from Pdf:
1. Construct words from each characters.
2. Construct lines from words.
3. Sparse Lines => More than one text piece in a line/ Conditions 1,2

We divide the table boundary detection problem into four main sub-problems as follows:
1) Construct the lines in a document page; 
2) Remove all the non-sparse lines from the line set; 
3) Remove all the noisy sparse lines; 
4) Label table lines by considering the keywords
