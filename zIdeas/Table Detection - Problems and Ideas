Table Detection
Problems:
Superscript and Subscript Detection -> use the sequence of text tags' positions. Increase in top and back to normal. Decrease in top and then back to normal.
//Multiple text tags of same line -> Group them with spaces = nextleft - prevleft.. Consider it as sparse
Bold, italics and other tags ?
Incrementally choose features??, Gaussian prior??
what is the weight parameter theta in the paper for boosting??

Ideas
Using features of pdftohtml -> Single line in multiple text tags, Bold of Table captions
Try using other software packages(mallet, Alchemy, Tuffy) and R, Matlab, Octave etc

Points
Once you have removed non sparse lines, you might add them back if it is within the table boundary.
Sparse Line Cond2: Length of sparse line < half document width
Font size feature can also be included in CRF

========================== Algorithm cut 1 begins here =============================
Flow:
Preprocessing:
Remove <i> and <b> tags
Merge Superscript and Subscript in a single line.
Merge Multiple text pieces into a single line -> (Mark as Sparse Line)

Training Data Collection:
Create a HTML page with preprocessed pdf 
Each line/text tag -> default non sparse. Label all the SPARSE LINES and THEIR TYPES
[Atleast 10 pdfs to begin with]

Training:
Define the Features in terms of Feature functions <--- Carefully choose features
Train a CRF model based on these features and calculate the values of Lambda. (SGD?)[maximize likelihood]

Sequence labeling:
Modified Vitterbi Algorithm to maximize the probability.

==========================After this try other algorithms=============================
