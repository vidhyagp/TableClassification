MORE GOOD FEATURES

Perform Cross Validation (Stratified Sampling) for getting the approximate model (due to lack of training data)
Or try bootstrap aggregation

CRF with real valued features?? [How to Normalize]
Should label other kind of sparse lines too?
what is the gaussian prior and L1 regularization used for?
Learning CRF other algorithms - LBFGS, Newton Method etc? Gibbs Sampling for approximate inference??

Table text followed by A or I, II or Nothing: Outliers!
